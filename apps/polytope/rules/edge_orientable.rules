# Ordered list of edges of a Moebius strip with parallel interior edges. 
# Consists of k lines of the form (v<sub>i</sub> w<sub>i</sub>), for i=1, ..., k. 
#
# The Moebius strip in question is given by the quadrangles 
# (v<sub>i</sub>, w<sub>i</sub>, w<sub>i+1</sub>,v<sub>i+1</sub>), for i=1, ..., k-1, and the quadrangle (v<sub>1</sub>, w<sub>1</sub>, v<sub>k</sub>, w<sub>k</sub>).

# Validity can be verified with the client [[validate_moebius_strip]].
# The polytope is required to be 2-cubical.
