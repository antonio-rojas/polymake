# @topic category functions/Producing a polytope from scratch
# With these clients you can create polytopes belonging to various parameterized
# families which occur frequently in polytope theory, as well as random
# polytopes with different models of randomness.


# @topic category functions/Producing a polytope from polytopes
# An important way of constructing polytopes is to modify an 
# already existing polytope.
#
# Actually, these functions don't alter the input polytope
# (it is forbidden in polymake), but create a new polytope object.
#
# Many functions can at your choice either calculate the vertex or facet coordinates,
# or constrain themselves on the purely combinatorial description of the
# resulting polytope.


# @topic category functions/Transformations
# These functions take a realized polytope and produce a new one by applying a
# suitable affine or projective transformation in order to obtain some special
# coordinate description but preserve the combinatorial type.
#
# For example, before you can polarize an arbitrary polyhedron, it
# must be transformed to a combinatorially equivalent bounded polytope with the
# origin as a relatively interior point. It is achieved with the sequence
# [[orthantify]] - [[bound]] - [[center]] - [[polarize]].


# @topic category functions/Coordinate conversions
# The following functions allow for the conversion of the coordinate type of cones and polytopes.


# @topic category functions/Comparing
# Functions based on graph isomorphisms.


# @topic category functions/Producing a cone
# Various constructions of cones.


# @topic category functions/Producing a polytope from graphs
# Polytope constructions which take graphs as input.

# @topic category functions/Producing a point configuration
# Constructing a point configuration, either from scratch or from existing objects.


# @topic category functions/Producing other objects
# Functions producing big objects which are not contained in application polytope.


# @topic category functions/Quotient spaces
# Topologic cell complexes defined as quotients over polytopes modulo a discrete group.

# @topic category preferences/Convex hull computation
# descriptions of various convex hull algorithms available in polymake
