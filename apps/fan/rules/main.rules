# @topic application
# This application deals with polyhedral fans. You can define a fan, e.g. via its [[RAYS]] and [[MAXIMAL_CONES]]
# and compute several properties like [[HASSE_DIAGRAM]] and [[F_VECTOR]].

# A polyhedral fan.
# The current restriction is that each cone in the fan has to be pointed.  This will be relaxed later.
# If a fan is specified via [[INPUT_RAYS]] and [[INPUT_CONES]] each input cone must list all the input rays incident.
#
# Once non-trivial linealities are allowed the following will apply:
# The [[RAYS]] always lie in a linear subspace which is complementary to the [[LINEALITY_SPACE]].
declare object PolyhedralFan<Scalar=Rational> [ is_ordered_field(Scalar) ];

# A polyhedral complex.  The derivation from [[PolyhedralFan]] works like the derivation of [[Polytope]] from [[Cone]].
declare object PolyhedralComplex<Scalar=Rational> [ is_ordered_field(Scalar) ] : PolyhedralFan<Scalar>;
