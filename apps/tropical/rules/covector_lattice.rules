object CovectorLattice {

	#@category Combinatorics
	# Each node in the face lattice is a cell of a covector decomposition (of either the tropical torus
	# or the tropical span of some points). This property maps each cell to the corresponding covector.
	# A covector is encoded as an IncidenceMatrix, where rows correspond to coordinates and columns to 
	# [[POINTS]].
