# FIXME #775
# A tropical hypersurface is the set of points in R<sup>d</sup> for which
# the minimum of a tropical polynomial is attained at least twice. It is given as a
# list of [[MONOMIALS]] and [[COEFFICIENTS]].
# 
# polymake supports tropical hypersurfaces given by a homogeneous or inhomogeneous polynomial.
# Visualization functions will take homogeneity into account and provide suitbale pictures (e.g.,
# a tropical hypersurface defined by a homogeneous tropical polynomial in three variables will give
# a planar picture.
#
# Throughout a tropical hypersurface is seen as a rational polyhedral complex in R<sup>d</sup>
# (if inhomogeneous) or in R<sup>d-1</sup> (if homogeneous). 
#
# Our default tropical addition is [[Min]].  If you prefer [[Max]] use that as an optional template parameter.
#
# Example: max-tropical line with apex (-1,-2,-3) in the tropical 2-torus:
# $H = new [[Hypersurface]]<Max>([[MONOMIALS]]=>[ [1,0,0],[0,1,0],[0,0,1] ], [[COEFFICIENTS]]=>[1,2,3]);
