# @topic application
# The application group provides basic functionality for working with
# permutation groups. An object of type [[Group]] records the abstract
# properties of the groups that do not depend on any particular
# representation, such as ([[Group::ORDER|ORDER]],
# [[Group::CHARACTER_TABLE|CHARACTER_TABLE]] and [[Group::CONJUGACY_CLASS_SIZES|CONJUGACY_CLASS_SIZES]].
# Moreover, it can contain several subobjects of type [[group::PermutationAction]], [[group::PermutationActionOnSets]] 
# or [[group::ImplicitActionOnSets]] that encode representations of the group. (We use the terms //action//
# and //representation// interchangeably). If the group object is not contained inside a [[polytope::Cone]] or 
# [[polytope::Cone]], the representation in question is encoded as a [[Group::PERMUTATION_ACTION]], [[Group::SET_ACTION]] or 
# [[Group::IMPLICIT_SET_ACTION]], otherwise it may be encoded more specifically as a RAY_ACTION, FACET_ACTION,
# COORDINATE_ACTION, etc. Different representations of the same group are convertible
# among each other either via specific rules, or by using the function [[group::induced_action]], for example.
