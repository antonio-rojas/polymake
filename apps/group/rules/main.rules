# @topic application
# The application group provides basic functionality for working with permutation
# groups. An object of type [[Group]] is defined by a list of [[Group::GENERATORS|GENERATORS]] describing the 
# permutation of some indices. 
# The object [[GroupOfCone]] encapsulates symmetry information of a [[polytope::Cone|Cone]].
# It can act on the indices of rays ([[GroupOfCone::DOMAIN|DOMAIN]]=>1), of facets ([[GroupOfCone::DOMAIN|DOMAIN]]=>2), or on coordinates ([[GroupOfCone::DOMAIN|DOMAIN]]=>3).
