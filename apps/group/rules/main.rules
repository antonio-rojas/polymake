# @topic application
# The application group provides basic functionality for working with permutation
# groups. An object 'Group' is defined by a list of generators describing the 
# permutation of some indices. 
# The object 'GroupOfCone' encapsulates symmetry information of a cone.
# It can act on the indices of rays (DOMAIN=>1), of facets(2), or on coordinates(3).
