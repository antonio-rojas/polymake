# @topic category functions/Producing a matroid from matroids
# These functions construct a new [[Matroid]] from other objects of the same type.

# @topic category functions/Producing a matroid from scratch
# With these clients you can create special examples of matroids belonging to parameterized families.

# @topic category functions/Producing a matroid from other objects
# These functions construct a new [[Matroid]] from other objects.

object Matroid {

# @topic category properties/Axiom systems
# These are properties that form (part of) an axiom system defining a matroid.
# Most of these can be used to create a matroid.

# @topic category properties/Advanced properties
# These are more complex properties of the matroid.

# @topic category properties/Enumerative properties
# These are properties of a matroid that count something.

# @topic category properties/Input properties
# These are properties that can be used to define a matroid, but do not actually constitute an axiom system.
