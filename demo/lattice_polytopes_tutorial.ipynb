    "# Tutorial for Lattice Polytopes\n",
    "\n",
    "This page gives a small introduction to lattice polytopes in `polymake`, some useful external software, and usage hints for it. For a list of methods and properties applicable to lattice polytopes see [here](:user_guide:lattice_polytopes_doc). For an introduction to the `polymake` package see [here](:user_guide:start). \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "`polymake` always assumes that the lattice used to define a lattice polytope is the standard lattice Z<sup>d</sup>. Some rules also require that the polytope is full dimensional. There are user functions that transform a polytope sitting in some affine subspace of R<sup>d</sup> into a full dimensional polytope, either in the induced lattice or the lattice spanned by the vertices, see below. \n",

    "## Dependence on other Software\n",
    "\n",
    "For some computations `polymake` has no built-in commands and passes the computation to external software. Currently, polymake has an interface to the following packages that compute various properties of lattice polytopes.\n",
    "\n",
    "*  [libnormaliz](http://www.math.uos.de/normaliz/) by Winfried Bruns and Bogdan Ichim, bundled with polymake\n",
    "\n",
    "*  [4ti2](http://www.4ti2.de/) by the 4ti2 team\n",
    "\n",
    "*  [LattE macchiato](http://www.math.ucdavis.edu/~mkoeppe/latte/) by Matthias Köppe, building on `LattE`  by Jesus de Loera et. al.\n",
    "\n",
    "*  ([barvinok](http://freshmeat.net/projects/barvinok) by Sven Verdoolaege)\n",
    "\n",
    "Unless you want to deal with Hilbert bases of cones you don't need them. If you do, either the bundled extension `libnormaliz` or the external package `4ti2` suffices to do most computations with lattice polytopes. Computation of Gröbner bases currently requires `4ti2`. `LattE` only counts lattice points in a polytope and computes its Ehrhart polynomial, but may be faster on that than any other methods implemented. `barvinok` can be used to compute the number of lattice points and the  h<sup></sup>-polynomial. Access to barvinok is realized via an extension which has to be downloaded separately.\n",
    "\n",
    " For some of the commands in this tutorial you will need at least one of `bundled:libnormaliz` enabled  or `4ti2` installed on your machine. We'll remind you at the relevant places.\n",
