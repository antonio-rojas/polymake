You seem to run the polymake image directly.
This is possible but will lack many important third-party packages
and the possibility to start locally installed visualisation programs.

The recommended way is to use a starter script polymake-in-container.sh
which arranges for execution of locally installed programs and mounts your home directory
within the container.

You can extract this script directly from this image to a location of your choice:

  docker cp <CONTAINER-NAME>:/usr/local/share/polymake/resources/polymake-in-container.sh <YOUR-DIR>/

For more details, please refer to  https://polymake.org/doku.php/howto/dockerimage

If you really want to run the polymake image in isolation, add an option

  --entrypoint /usr/local/bin/polymake

to your docker run command.
