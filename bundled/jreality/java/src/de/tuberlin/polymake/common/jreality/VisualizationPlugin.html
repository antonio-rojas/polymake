    Polymake Visualization
  </h1>
  <p>
  	The polymake visualization plugin shows a list of all geometry objects displayed by the viewer and
  	allows to modify their individual appearances. The appearance of an object can be stored in the object
  	itself, in a so-called attribute, or in an appearance. There exists a hierarchy of appearances, so the
  	content appearance might be overwritten by an object appearance. If colors or other display paramaters 
  	are stored in attributes, then these overwrite the parameters set in the appearances.
  </p>
  <ul>
  	<li> 
  	  Split/Rescan: You can split a polyhedron into its components to assign individual colors to its faces. You need to 
  	  press "Rescan" to update the list of geometries.
  	</li>
  	<li>
  	  Clear App./Attr.: Use these to buttons to remove the display parameters from the selected geometry.
  	</li>
  	<li> 
  	  Arrows: In case of oriented edges, you might want to add arrows.
  	</li>
  	<li>
  	  Auxiliary: Display additional geometry and coordinate systems.
